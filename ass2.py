
# 2: Write a simple program to print the list in reverse order (you can use any kind of method).


# from audioop import reverse


# from audioop import reverse

# Marks = [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

# # list.reverse()

# Marks.reverse()

# print(Marks)

# 4. Is there any way to change the value of the tuple? If there is then write a program as an example,
# if not then give the reason with proper examples.

# T = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

# lst = list(T)

# lst[1] = '20'
# T =tuple(lst)

# print(T)



# Q5: Write a python program to interchange the first and last elements in a list

# num = [10,20,30,40,50]

# num[0] = 50
# num[-1] = 10

# print(num)
